# Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving
Welcome to the Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving GitHub repository! This project is at the forefront of integrating Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) with reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to revolutionize control systems in autonomous vehicles. Our research dives into the dynamic world of autonomous driving, comparing the innovative capabilities of QNNs against traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) within the simulated environment of donkey-warehouse-v0 from gym-donkeycar.
# About the Project
This project is based on a groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at Northwestern University, exploring the potential of quantum computing to enhance machine learning models for autonomous vehicle control. Using a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) framework, we evaluate the performance of both quantum and classical neural networks in navigating complex driving scenarios.
# Objectives
- To Compare QNNs and DNNs: Assess the computational advantages and efficiency of Quantum Neural Networks in comparison to traditional Deep Neural Networks within the context of reinforcement learning for autonomous driving.
- Advanced Control Systems: Explore the integration of quantum computing principles with classical machine learning techniques to develop sophisticated control systems for autonomous vehicles.
- Practical Implementation: Bridge the gap between theoretical advancements in quantum computing and their tangible applications in autonomous vehicle technology, with the goal of transitioning optimized models to physical robots or cars for real-world testing.
# Technology Stack
- Google Colab with GPU support: Leveraging cloud-based GPUs for efficient model training.
- OpenAI Gym Framework & DonkeyCar Simulator: Utilizing the donkey-warehouse-v0 environment for realistic autonomous driving simulations.
